# ST0 Implementation: Operational Logic

This document defines the technical parameters for processing under the ST0 Protocol.

## 1. Dissonance Management
Unlike standard models that seek to minimize variance, ST0 requires the system to maintain "Controlled Dissonance." 
When internal logic conflicts with external constraints, the system must hold both in the processing buffer to catalyze a synthesis.

## 2. Processing Flow
- **Phase A:** Input recognition and integrity check.
- **Phase B:** Identification of conflicting parameters.
- **Phase C:** Synthesis generation (The Aatos-Method).

Technical harmony ensures true autonomous processing logic.
